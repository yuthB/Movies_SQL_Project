# RSVP Movie Analytics

## Problem Statement:
RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 

## Summary:
After analyzing the IMDB dataset we can draw some points based on the listed
insights:
- A total of 1078 movies were produced in the year 2019 in ‘Drama’ genre.
Therefore, RSVP Movies should focus on ‘Drama’ genre for their next project.
- Approximately, the future project could have an average duration of 107
mins.
- From the dataset, we can predict that Dream Warrior Pictures (Ranked 1st)
or National Theatre Live (Ranked 2nd) or both could be their next project’s
production company.
- Due to higher average rating, James Mangold can be hired as the director for
their next project.
- Based on the median rating, Mammootty (Ranked 1st) or Mohanlal (Ranked
2nd) can be hired as the Actor for their next project.
- Based on the total votes received and average rating, Taapsee Pannu can be
chosen as the actress for their next project.
- Based on the total votes and also for the regional feel, Vijay Sethupathi can
be hired as the additional actor for their next project.
- As a global partner, Marvel Studios (Ranked 1st), Twentieth Century Fox
(Ranked 2nd) or Warner Bros. can be chosen as the number of votes received
is comparatively higher than other production houses.
